Code golf exercise for the Christchurch JavaScript Meetup.

A rough port to Node.js of the work done in Ruby by Daniel Fone for the NZ Rails Camp.
All credit due to him. (buy him a beer sometime ok?)

If you're looking for his ruby version check it out here: https://github.com/danielfone/railscamp-codegolf/

As mentioned by Daniel, this is horribly insecure. Only let your friends run arbitrary code on your server. If you're running
this on a server that matters to you, then perhaps you need to talk to Bob Newhart https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gyL1QFcls0

Another exercise when they get bored of code golf would be to see how few bytes would be required to bring the server to a halt. :)
